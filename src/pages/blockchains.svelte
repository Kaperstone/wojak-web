    <li>❌ xDai (now `Gnosis Chain`)<br>
        Lets be honest - It is dead, it is now takenover by Gnosis and the project is now for-profit centered.
        Because of the merge, [STAKE] holders had to exchange their tokens for [GNO] at a very low rate, making its investors lose money.
        Which further emphasize the how careless `Gnosis` *is* towards its investors.
        I am not going to support a blockchain that does not care for its investors, this is not ethical and the Gnosis expressed hostility and centrality

    <li>🤔 GoChain (probably)</li>
    <li>🤔 WanChain (Community poll)</li>
    <li>❌ Solana<br>
        Disregarding that I will have to rewrite the smart contracts in whole another language, Solana's recent `pause the entire blockchain` expressed
        that the blockchain developer have central power over the blockchain, which means, if DeFi will evolve in it, the blockchain developers can halt the blockchain
        and your money will be stuck in Smart Contracts.<br>
        Nonetheless, the recent network slowdown expressed the blockchain incompetence.

    <li>❌ Cardano<br>
        Depends on the support of the community.<br>

    </li>
    <li>❌ Elrond<br>
        Old but not forgotten, the change from 1000:1 token to decrease the amount of tokens and the ticker rename from [ERD] to [eGold] (Electronic Gold), shows the project leads arrogance. 
        No blockchain should ever think they are the digital gold, its the people who decide whether you are or not.

        Maybe, kind of, one day.

    <li>🤔 Mina</li>
    <li>🤔 Luna</li>
    <li>❌ XRPL (bro, no)<br>
        maybe anyone can open a validator or a stock server, but there are only 6 masternodes, and you don't vote for them.<br>
        No one earns rewards but those masternodes.<br>

        We don't support `Central Authority` blockchain.
