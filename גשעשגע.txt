20% of supply 5,000 is 1,000

20% of 
    user1 100 = 20
    user2 20 = 4
    user3 1 = 0.2
    user4 50 = 10
    user5 99 = 19.8
    user6 2230 = 446
    user7 2500 = 500
    is still 1000


Lets say user7 doesn't stake, then the inflation is 500

In other words, individual guarnteed 20% per person, is better than global 20%
